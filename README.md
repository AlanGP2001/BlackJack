### Purpose:
A traditional BlackJack web app

The main goal was to practice building apps in shorter time periods. This meant pre-planning with hi-fi wire-framing using Adobe XD, using React-Bootstrap while developing with React, practicing animations, and intentional breaking code into smaller components.
